### Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

1. **Scan infrastructure as code templates:**
* CFRipper - Checks Cloud Formation templates for Security Compliance pre-deployment
* CloudSploit
* OpenPolicy/Regula - Checks Terraform Templates for Security Compliance pre-deployment
* TerraScan

***Example vulnerability***

``CloudFormationAuthenticationRule`` checks that no ``AWS::CloudFormation::Authentication`` resource contains plain text credentials.

It ensures that no secrets are stored in clear text and printed in clear text in the AWS console.


2. **Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities:**

**Anchore Engine** - performs static vulnerability analysis on Containers

***Example vulnerability***
Checks Third Party installs and return a list that indicates which of them have bugs/ vulnerabilities.

For example:


|Vulnerability ID       |Package                               |Severity         | Fix                |Vulnerability URL|
|---                     |---                                   |---               |---          |---                                                               |
|CVE-2018-1000802        |libpython2.7-minimal-2.7.15-4        | High             | 2.7.15-5      |     https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000802|  


3. **Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities**
AWS Config


***Example vulnerability***
s3-bucket-logging-enabled: This checks if s3 buckets have logging enabled
iam-password-policy-prevent-reuse-check: hecks whether the account password policy for IAM users prevents password reuse.
