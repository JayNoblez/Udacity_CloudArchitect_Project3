# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
___

1. **Unauthorized:EC2/SSHBruteForce on attacking instance** - the EC2 instance is performing a brute force attack to guess SSH password another instance in my VPC.
2. **Unauthorized:EC2/SSHBruteForce on Web Service Instance -C3** - the EC2 instances is under an SSH brute force attack

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
___

Amazon GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. In this case, the VPC flow logs is the main source of information to catch this attack activity. The VPC flow logs capture information about IP traffic to and from Amazon EC2 Network interfaces in the VPC. 

This means that the multiple failed attempts (in quick succession) to access the Web Server instance from same IP address indicates a malicious attack and triggers a Brute force attack alert. The reference details for this attack can be found in the VPC flow logs written to S3 (if configured).
