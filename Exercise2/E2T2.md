## Q: Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
___

**A:** The following failed security checks in AWS Security Hub indicates vulnerabilities. They are classified either as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW severity. 

1. **Aplication Load balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS** - 

This check fails because the load balancers listeners in this exercise were not configured to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Failing this check directly violates the protection of data in transit using TLS/SSL Encryption.

```
Severity: Medium.
Resource: ELBv2 Load Balancer
AWS Config rule: alb-http-to-https-redirection-check
```

 **Remediation** - In the EC2 pane, the configuration for the ALB can be adjusted such that the HTTP listener(80) is adjusted to support HTTPS (443) instead. A certificate/ domain name would be required to make this change.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
