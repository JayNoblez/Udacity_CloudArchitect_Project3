### In this exercise, based on:
___
* the architecture diagram, 
* steps to upload data into s3 bucket, and
* the mode of access to the application web service.

**2 obviously poor security practices** which were identified include:
___

1. The access to the Application web service is configured too open. This can be seen from the c3-app.yml file which is set to allow access from all resources.
               ```" Action: 's3:*'
                Resource: '*'
                ```
  
***Justification***: This is not best practice as regards security. Given the principle of least privilege, it is always advisable to lock down access to only resources which need them in order to reduce the blast radius of compromise if it happens.
  
2. Default encryption was not enabled on the s3 buckets. The buckets are not restricitng/blocking public access.


***Justification***: This could jeopardize data security, especially when it contains sensitive information like the secret recipe in this exercise
