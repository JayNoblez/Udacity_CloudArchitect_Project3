### In this exercise, based on:
___
* the architecture diagram, 
* steps to upload data into s3 bucket, and
* the mode of access to the application web service.

**2 obviously poor security practices** which were identified include:
___

1. The access to the Application web service is configured too open. This can be seen from the c3-app.yml file which is set to allow access from all resources.
               ```" Action: 's3:*'
                Resource: '*'
                ```
2. Default encryption was not enabled on the s3 buckets. 
Justification: This is a misconfiguration that places the data security at risk.
