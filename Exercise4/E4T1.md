### 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
___

1. ``restrict-ssh`` - Configure attached security group rule such that only a specific allowed list of IP address can access the EC2 instances over the port 22. e.g. MyIP

 2.  Disable Password Authentication in */etc/ssh/sshd_config*
   

### Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, In the event that instance API credentials were compromised, how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
___

This event of compromise can always be prevented using a **least privilege approach**. 
1. The instance role profile should attach temporary permissions to the resources that need to be accessed. For instance, specific arn to get the Object.
Also, make sure that the s3 buckets policy specify only necessary permissions, other than "allow all" 

2. Enable Default Encryption on the S3 bucket such that the objects are encrypted on store.
