# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

1. Enforce Encryption at rest - AWS KMS.  For instance, automate data at rest protection. This implies using automated tools to automate validation that all EBS volumes are encrypted for example
2. A CDN such as Cloudflare, Cloudfront can be the first point of access into the VPC. Not only does this have good cost benefits, it can handle DDos Scenarios better, and has some WAF implementations.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No. The IAM permission are the key to secure access. With an insecure/compromise API key, an attacker can pretty much tamper with the system and reconfigure access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Applying Default encryption only encrypts subsequent uploads to the s3 Bucket.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The Original Cloud Formation templates would revert the stack back to the old insecure configuration. Any changes to enhance security should be reflected in the IAC in order to persist changes.
